        <h2>I absolutely <em>LOVE</em> Hockey</h2>
        <p>It's inescapable; if you ever have a conversation with me, I can guarantee that at some point hockey will become part of the discussion. I've played it, refereed it, coached it, helped found a Tier 2 Junior A hockey team, and follow the Detroit Red Wings closer than most people regard their religion.</p>
        <hr class="wedge">
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>While not near as often as I did as a youth, I still very much enjoy playing video games. I'm not a stuck-up snobby console fanboy; I'm proud to include myself amongst the Elite Race (PC). From the Battlefield to the depths of Diablo's fiery wastelands, I like and play 'em all.</p>
        <hr class="wedge">
        <h2>Television</h2>
        <p>I don't spend a lot of time in front of the TV, although I've enjoyed watching Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Lost Ship, and Trailer Park Boys.</p>
        <hr class="wedge">
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Anything with meat and/or cheese. To expand on that a little bit, anything with meat and/or cheese.</p>
        <hr class="wedge">
        <h2>Politics</h2>
        <p>I read enough of the daily news from around the world to know that I don't want to involve myself in politics. It's confusing, boring, and no matter what your opinion or stance is, you're probably wrong. What's the point?</p>
        <hr class="wedge">
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>If it's too loud, you're too old! I'll listen to and can appreciate just about any music, but my heart and soul belong to the screaming stringed demons of Metal. I regret giving up playing bass guitar at a young age, but I've since picked up an electric guitar, and enjoy a strum or two from time to time.</p>
